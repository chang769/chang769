## [Chang Shu](www.changshu.fun)
I am a Ph.D. student (in the 4th year) in Building Engineering at [Concordia University](https://www.concordia.ca/) supervised by [Dr. Leon Wang](https://users.encs.concordia.ca/~leonwang/moodle/), currently working with [Dr. Abhishek Gaur](https://nrc.canada.ca/en/corporate/contact-us/nrc-directory-science-professionals/abhishek-gaur) and [Dr. Michael Lacasse](https://nrc.canada.ca/en/corporate/contact-us/nrc-directory-science-professionals/michael-lacasse) at the [Construction Research Center](https://nrc.canada.ca/en/research-development/research-collaboration/research-centres/construction-research-centre)of [National Research Council Canada (NRC)](https://nrc.canada.ca/en) in Ottawa.
During my Ph.D. study, I have been involved in multiple projects of different topics:

* Air curtain design and operation opitmization. [Link>>](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.buildenv.2019.106582), [Link>>](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jweia.2020.104265), [Link>>](https://users.encs.concordia.ca/~leonwang/moodle/mod/book/view.php?id=15&chapterid=12)
* Sub-scale modeling and Re-independent theory of urban aerodynamics. [Link>>](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jweia.2020.104232), [Link>>](https://users.encs.concordia.ca/~leonwang/moodle/mod/book/view.php?id=15&chapterid=17)
* Airflow managements of indoor growing farms. [Link>>](https://users.encs.concordia.ca/~leonwang/moodle/mod/book/view.php?id=15&chapterid=18)
* Energy efficiency and ventilation system optimiation of a road tunnel. [Link>>](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/332604923_Deep_Learning_of_a_Real_Road_Tunnel_Energy_Demand_Using_Recurrent_Neural_Networks)
* Summertime building overheating assessment and mitigation during heatwaves. [Link>>](https://users.encs.concordia.ca/~cube/index.html#)
* Weather data generation using Weather Research and Forecasing (WRF). [Link>>](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.uclim.2020.100737), [Link>>](https://ams.confex.com/ams/101ANNUAL/meetingapp.cgi/Paper/379898)
* Statistical downscaling of high-resolution climate data for Canadian Cities. [Link>>](https://ams.confex.com/ams/101ANNUAL/meetingapp.cgi/Paper/379904)
